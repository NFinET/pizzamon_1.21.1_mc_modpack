These are custom Data Packs specifically made for this modpack and brief explanations of why they exist / what they do.

- Pizzamon_BCA_CobbleTowns1.1.3_CobbleDollars
This is a customized copy of CobbleTowns (made under MIT license from the Modrinth entry here: https://modrinth.com/datapack/cobbletowns-continued ) that makes the Pokemart employees from it use CobbleDollars instead of villager trades. It also rebalances and unifies the shop inventories of Pokemart Employees from Cobblemon Additions (BCA). Both are done to match the configured default shop from the CobbleDollars mod configs. Finally, it also integrates the items from the mod Max Repel into the shop inventories of both.

- Pizzamon_PartingGiftsDrops
This is a config datapack for the mod Cobblemon: Parting Gifts that customizes the release rewards for this modpack. This includes a variety of species specific tables, some customized typing tables, and some new global tables for specific abilities or known moves.
