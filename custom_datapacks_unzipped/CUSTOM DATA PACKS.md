These are custom Data Packs specifically made for this modpack and brief explanations of why they exist / what they do.

- **Pizzamon_BCA_CobbleTowns1.1.3_CobbleDollars**
  - This is a customized copy of CobbleTowns (made under MIT license from the Modrinth entry here: https://modrinth.com/datapack/cobbletowns-continued ) that makes the Pokemart employees from it use CobbleDollars instead of villager trades. It also rebalances and unifies the shop inventories of Pokemart Employees from Cobblemon Additions (BCA). Both are done to match the configured default shop from the CobbleDollars mod configs. Finally, it also integrates the items from the mod Max Repel into the shop inventories of both.

- **Pizzamon_PartingGiftsDrops**
  - This is a config datapack for the mod Cobblemon: Parting Gifts that customizes the release rewards for this modpack. This includes a variety of species specific tables, some customized typing tables, and some new global tables for specific abilities or known moves.

- **Pizzamon_BotanyPotsModule**
  - This is a compatibility patch datapack for Botany Pots, adding support for crops from other mods in the Pizzamon pack that are missing native support or have no publicly available patches I could find.

- **Pizzamon_ApothicEnchantingModule**
  - This is a compatibility patch datapack for Apothic Enchanting, adding support for some more items to have Apothic Enchanting system bonus stats. Adds support for Skull Piles from Amendments, and also adds support for Pokedolls from Pokeblocks (however this requires an additional script from the KubeJS Server scripts to apply the required tagging via regex)
  
- **Pizzamon_CobbledGacha_Data**
  - Configuration override patch for CobbledGacha based on a template provided by the CobbledGacha dev. Overrides the data-related elements.
