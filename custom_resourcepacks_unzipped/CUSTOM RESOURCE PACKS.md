These are custom Resource Packs specifically made for this modpack and brief explanations of why they exist / what they do.

- Pizzamon_CobbleVillagers_Name_Fix
This fixes a language translation key error for a couple of villager professions for en_us from the mods CobbleDollars and Legendary Monuments that caused those professions to display their entire namespace key as the profession name in Jade and some other GUIs.

- PizzamonLogo
Pretty self explanatory, but this is what changes the Minecraft titlescreen logo to the custom one made for this pack ( I drew it myself c: )
