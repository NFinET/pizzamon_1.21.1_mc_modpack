If this is being submitted for a crash, you're using the wrong template, go back and select the "Crash" template.

**Modpack Version**
First of all, what version of the modpack were you using? Have you modified ANYTHING about it?

**Describe the bug**
Is it a bug? An error code popping up? A rendering issue or UI error? etc. Describe it as best you can. 

**Environment**
Were you in singleplayer, joining multiplayer LAN, hosting multiplayer LAN, or playing on a dedicated server when the issue happened? (If you're here from The Pizza Party & Pals, this is "Dedicated Server")
If you were in multiplayer, did this cause problems for other players on the server, or were you the only one affected?

**To Reproduce**
If you know how to reproduce it and can, how did you trigger it? If you don't know, what were you doing right before it happened?

**Expected behavior**
If it's something going wrong, what was SUPPOSED to happen or what were you otherwise expecting to happen?

**Screenshots/Video**
If applicable and you have them or are able to provide them, add screenshots or a link to a video to help explain your problem.

**Logs**
If applicable and you have them, please provide your dated log / latest log. If you're using Prism launcher, these can be found in the "Edit" page of the modpack, in the "Other Logs" tab. You can use the dropdown selector to find it. If you've launched the game a second time since the issue happened,  your latest log will have changed names, and you will need to select a different log from the list with the date of when the log was made.
