**Modpack Version**
First of all, what version of the modpack were you using? Have you modified ANYTHING about it?

**Describe the crash type / environment**
Did this happen in singleplayer, in a multiplayer LAN server you joined, in a multiplayer LAN server you hosted, or a dedicated server? If in multiplayer, did the server or any other players crash, or just you? (If you're here from The Pizza Party & Pals server, you want "Dedicated Server", and please also add the time and date of when the crash occurred)

**Hardware**
How much RAM did you allocate to the pack, and how much RAM total does your computer have? If you know your processor and graphics card models, list them as well.

**To Reproduce / Context**
If you know and can prove this crash is repeatable, how did you do it? If you're not sure or don't know, what else were you (or any other involved players) doing leading up to when it happened?

**Error Code**
If the crash was a "soft crash" and your client didn't close or gave an error screen, please provide a screenshot or copy paste of the error code. If this was a hard crash or there was no code, ignore this.

**Crash Assistant**
If this crash was caught by Crash Assistant (A pop-up after the crash with a bunch of buttons) please link,  upload or copy paste the entire "latest.log" file from it.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
