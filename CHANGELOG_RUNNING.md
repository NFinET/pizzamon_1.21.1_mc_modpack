  - Server\_scripts  
    - Main.json  
      - New scripting has been added to add the “\#c:hidden\_from\_recipe\_viewers” tag to all items from the mods Every Compat (Wood Good), Every Compat (Stone Zone), to reduce strain on JEI/EMI. This has reduced the visible items by an overal estimated 30%. The items are NOT disabled and their recipes are still accessible, they are just hidden from view to save loading time  
      - New scripting has been added to give various types of Dough the “\#c:dough” tag, allowing the Create alternate slimeball recipe to use most doughs from other mods  
      - New scripting to remove the visibility of Neptunium items from Aquaculture as they are disabled and not intended to be obtainable

  - OTBWG villages, vanilla villages, and most Cobbletowns villagesthat attempt to spawn will be “soft-blocked” and have their structure type re-rolled using only the Cobblemon Additions (BCA) and CobbleTowns village types.  
  - Overhauled biome tags and added new biomes and tags to all desired villages matching their styles and theming.   
  - Default weighting for BCA village size categories has been maintained and standardized (Large: 5, Med: 27, Small: 39\) and all CobbleTowns villages have been balanced as if they were Small size BCA villages.   
  - The only exception is CobbleTown’s Pacifidlog Town, which was left completely untouched in all areas due to its unique spawning conditions (oceans)  
- Patchouli  
  - Began laying groundwork files for the custom in-game help guide, located in minecraft/patchouli\_books/Pizzamon\_Help\_Book
